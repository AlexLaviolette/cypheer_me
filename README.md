Program I wrote two years ago in High School. It is suppose to be a kind of messenger program: you can send and receive messages. It also includes an encryption option, it was based on the lorenz encryption device used by the Germans during the second World War, but is a lot more basic.

It was programmed in *Python* using the *graphics library*

### Possible Improvements

[ ] Make the encryption more intricate

[ ] Select which message to delete, instead of just the oldest one
